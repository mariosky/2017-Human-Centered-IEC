% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***

Interactive evolution is the leading technique employed by 
Evolutionary Art researchers, where users' preferences guide the search. A common
practice is to develop Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) algorithms
as web applications in order to give users easy access the application as they
often depend on volunteers who visit the system to interactively help with the search. 
There are several drawbacks that limit user participation 
such as human fatigue and boredom resulting from evaluating 
a large number of individuals. 
To tackle this issues, we propose the design of IEC systems using a user-centered 
approach, with a framework consisting of a social network of 
volunteers, interacting with a population consisting again of a network 
of individuals. In this work we propose a graph model as a viable 
and efficient tool for mapping in a natural way the relationships 
found in the system. A case study is presented as a proof of concept, 
providing both conceptual and implementation details of a graph based model as it is 
applied in the implementation of an IEA using the EvoSpace-Interactive platform. 
As a result, the graph model was then succesfully applied to measure the degree
of relationship between users with the porpuse of quantifing 
their participation.

\section{Introduction}
Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms (IEAs) are standard EAs whose
fitness evaluations are performed by persons within an interactive 
system.  Thus, the main loop of the EA needs the intervention of a
human for the quality assessment of each proposed solution.
IEAs have demonstrated their ability for effectively
producing art and design \cite{Bentley:1999:intro,Sims:1991,todd:1992},
as well as other products in many other domains \cite{ie1}. 
Several IECs have been developed as web based systems \cite{picbreeder},
who depend on volunteers who visit the system to interactively help
with the search, using both anonymous and registered users.
These systems have several inherent drawbacks arising from the very nature of 
the algorithms, namely, the human fatigue caused by the interaction, and
the boredom arising when users evaluate a large number of individuals 
many of which are not interesting or are very similar to each other.
IEAs also share some of the issues commonly found in volunteer based systems
\cite{sarmenta2001volunteer,web:BOINC} such as the volunteer\'s lack of accountability,
and the need to build trust between participants and application providers. 
For the provider there is also the difficulty of establishing 
the amount of time and resources
a volunteer is willing to spend on the system, and how they decide if they
participate or not \cite{JJ:2016}. In order to increase participation and 
engagement, and to tackle the issues mentioned above,  
IEAs must follow a user centered design, giving extensive attention 
to volunteer users, not only because their
explicit evaluation is essential, but also because the context of the 
interaction affects the system as a whole. Users interact not only with the graphical
interface, and each individual\'s phenotype, there is also the interaction
with other users, their previous evaluations and their own stream of activities
and past experiences. Thus users in this proposal are defined as dynamic entities 
interacting with an evolutionary computation having the fundamental purpose 
of evaluating individuals according to their preferences,
both explicitly or implicitly. In this work we propose giving the same
importance to users and their interactions as the population of 
individuals have in a traditional EA, even to the extend as using this
knowledge as an integral part of the evolutionary algorithm. We argue also
that a graph model is a viable representation for this purpose,  
presenting a natural way of maping the relationships found in the system. 
Most IEAs have the following many-to-many relations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item { \tt Individual-Individual} The relationships between individuals in the
  population are naturally expressed as a tree, or a graph when both ancestors 
  and descendants are considered. Other semantic relations can also be of interest
  for instance similarity or composition.

  \item {\tt User-Individual}
  Many kind of relationships between users and individuals,
  can be expressed using common actions found in social networks;
  for instance: share, like, rate or add to collection [cite Activity Streams 2.0
  syntax (https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary)]. In IEAs these
  relationships are used to assign a single or a collection of
  fitness values to individuals [cite ES-I].   

  \item {\tt User-User}
  Relationship between users can also be modeled 
  as a social network, with well stablished semantics, algorithms and metrics (cite).
  A graph model could eneable researchers to find other ways of identifyng leaders of 
  opinion or measuring the similarity between user\'s preferences. 
  These measures can then be used by recommender algorithms selecting 
  individuals according users\' preferences. 

\end{itemize}

These relations are naturaly maped to graphs, while other actions and 
properties can also be modeled as a semantic network using
basic subject–-predicate-–object expressions [cite Semantic triples].
Another reason for using a graph model is the tools available for
implementing and query the model, and the increased performance of
native graph database systems [cite Christian].

A case study is presented as a proof of concept, providing both
conceptual and implementation details of a graph data model applied in the 
implementation of an IEA. The experiment was implmented using
the EvoSpace-Interactive framework, and consisted of a web application
for evolving artistic drawings. The graph database is then used to
measure the degree of relationship between users and their participation.  

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section \ref{sec:interactive} presents related work on the topic 
of Interactive Evolution data models.
Then, Section \ref{sec:evospace-i} presents the computational platform on which 
the main proposal of this work is developed. The proposed graph model is 
presented in Section \ref{sec:graph}.
The experimental work and results are presented in Section \ref{sec:experiments}.
Finally, a concluding remarks are provided in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{EvoSpace-Interactive}
\label{sec:evospace-i} 
As a case study, a IEA was implented using the 
EvoSpace-Interactive (ES-I) platform \cite{garcia2013evospace}. %citation
A brief description of the aplication is presented next, focusing
on the data elements that where ported to the graph model.

\subsection{Fitness Assignment}
\label{sec:col}
The ES-I platform employs a collaborative technique,
where several registered users assign a quality assessment to a single
individual and then an aggregated fitness value is calculated. The fitness
assigned to each individual depends on the taste of each particular user, 
resulting in a many-to-many relationship between users and individuals. 
Many systems query this user-individual relation to extract relevant
knowledge about the process and the population, for instance showing the
most popular individual, or the the user with more participation \cite{picbreeder}.
In order to do this, data about individuals %what? Maybe data
                                %about individuals? - JJ
must be permanently stored, even
if they are no longer in the active population. 

\subsection{Collaboration}
\label{sec:col}
After entering the web application by using their Facebook account,
users can collaborate with their Facebook friends, 
sharing those individuals they like, or by taking individuals
from their friend\'s collections by using the web interface depicted 
in Figure \ref{fig:web}


At the top left corner list of Facebook friends is presented, 
to encourage users to interact with the system. In the central 
\emph{ Wall } area, an individual sampled from the population 
is shown to the user.
Here, the user can interact with the system in two ways.
He can assign a quality assessment to the individual using
a five star rating measure.
Additionally, a user can choose to add an image to one of their \emph{Collections}.
A collection is a special directory to store individuals a user prefers and wishes
to save. After the user finishes interacting the individual
on the Wall, he can choose to retrieve a new one from population.
At the left side, is the \emph{Collections} section.
The user can create several collections, to group and organize his favorite 
artifacts. Moreover, a user can browse the content of each collection and from
there share images through the social network.
When a user browses over an individual a detail pane shows how many users have
liked the individual. The pane also includes a link to the individual's 
details, the parents, genetic operators that created it, and genealogy information.
 
\section{IEC Human-centered framework}
\label{sec:graph}
The general goal of this research is to develop a human-centered [cite] framework
for interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) in order to increase
participation and also to minimize the amount of evaluations needed for the
evolutionary process in given IEC application. We deliberately use the more general
term Human instead of User, because humans are not always playing the role of
users in software engineering sense, they could just be interacting 
naturaly with their environment and with out knowing they are implicitly
evaluating a possible solution. In other cases the evaluation could be done
by the natural interactions of a group of humans in a collaborative fashion
or not. For instance the IEC algorithm could by trying to optimize 
the design of an exit sign in an airport, then the quality of this sign could be
determined by the average the time it takes a sample of people to 
find the exit. In this example there could be certain collaboration
between users if they are not traveling alone, of course this is only one of
the considerations designers could make. 
 
%I will keep it general for this section -Mario
%The current model is tailored 
%to the EvoSpace-I functionality and capabilities but it can be modified to 
%handle other platforms, just by adding new clases of nodes.

  \caption{User-Centerd Framework.}
  \label{fig:uc_framework}       
\end{figure*}

The human centered framework consists of three high level components depicted
in figure \ref{fig:uc_framework}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item { \tt Interactive Evolutionary Computational system.}  
  This is the real world system that we are going to represent in the model, 
  it consist of human users and their interactions with one or more individuals from
  the population. There are many ways in which humans could interact 
  with indivuals, this could be through a mobile device, a user interface 
  or by interacting with real world objects generated as part of the algorithm 
  [cite evodraw o unplugged].
  There is also the posibility that fitness or even part of the search 
  to be done by devices lended by the human [cite nodio].
  The information gathered through the interaction is the primary concern
  as it will guide the search. 

  \item {\tt IEC Data Model}
  A data model is used to describe the IEC system prior to a physical 
  implementation. 
  %% This block is maybe not needed but in our ES-I implementation
  %% we use Relational (PosgreSQL), Objects (JSON-Redis) and Graphs (Neo4J)
  Depending on the domain several techniques can be used.
  Parts of the system could be better described by an Entity relationship 
  modeling to be used in a relational database or a Class Digram for a 
  key-value store. 
  %%
  %%
  A graph is proposed for modelling the social network
  of users and their interaction with the population. This database 
  is the back-end of the system, is used by the EA and the user interface. 

  \item {\tt Evolutionary Algorithm} 
  The EA algorithm queries the graph model, and then updates those nodes that 
  are part of the population. The EA could also be done with the help of
  humans, for instance in the XY project [cite] artists physicaly created
  the new population.

% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
