Volunteer computing is a distributed computing system, in which people
provide their own computing resources or storage to contribute to a common effort.
If they run a script in a web page, collaboration is straightforward, but also ephemeral.
Resources depend on the amount of time a user participates, this means that 
the user has to be kept engaged to obtain as many computing cycles as
possible. In this paper, we analyze a volunteer-based evolutionary computing system called
NodIO with the objective of discovering rules that encourage volunteer
participation, making it more or less efficient. We present the results of
an experiment where a gammification technique is applied by adding a leaderboard 
showing the top registered contributors. In NodIO volunteers can
participate without the need to create an account, so the question was
if the need to register would hava a negative impact on user participation. 
The experiment results show that even if only a small percentege of users created an account,
those competing provided around 90% of the resources.
